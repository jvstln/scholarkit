Alright. So the first feature/mvp that we will focus on building out is a simple authentication (using the current stack..supabase and better-auth) and then an AI chat just like popular AI interfaces like chatgpt and grok. For the AI that should be integrated, I am thinking of gemini, if it is paid or there is a better one offering a better/free integration you can let me know
