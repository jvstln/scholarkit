Am building a project using the following stack

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **Next.js** - Full-stack React framework
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **shadcn/ui** - Reusable UI components
- **Hono** - Lightweight, performant server framework
- **oRPC** - End-to-end type-safe APIs with OpenAPI integration
- **Bun** - Runtime environment
- **Drizzle** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **PostgreSQL** - Database engine
- **Authentication** - Email & password authentication with Better Auth
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system
- **Supabase**

The name of the project is ScholarKit, a utility web app for student with AI integrated into it. The project is for my final year project at University of Nigeria Nsukka, Department of Computer Science and I have exactly one month to complete it. You can learn more about the project from the attached documents (if any).

Keep answers to questions brief and comprehensive except when writeups are required

The project has a $0.00 budget so always prefer free solutions. If you need to use paid solutions, try finding a better/free alternative and/or notify me about it
