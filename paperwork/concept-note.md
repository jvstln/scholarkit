# ScholarKit: Context‑Aware AI Toolkit for Smarter Student Success

## Background / Context

Students today juggle study schedules, course materials, performance
tracking, and exam prep, often manually, with little personalized
guidance.\
Educational stress levels are high and students often get confused of
how the system works, which diverges their focus. This impedes
performance, focus, and well-being

## Objective

To streamline and elevate student academic life by providing an
intelligent platform that:

- Tailors tutoring to course context and materials

- Automates academic planning and performance analysis

- Generates quizzes and resources for efficient study

## Proposed Solution / Approach

**ScholarKit** combines AI, productivity tools, and academic insight to
support students holistically. Key components include:

    tips---automatically generated

3.  **Quiz Generator**: Personalized quizzes from student notes and past
    papers

4.  **Resource Fetcher**: Curated institution-specific resources (e.g.
    UNN scholar materials)

5.  **Academic Utilities**: GPA calculator and document tools---all in
    one seamless workflow

## Target Beneficiaries
