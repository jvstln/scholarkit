## Problem Statement

In today\'s academic environment, students face increasing pressure to
manage large volumes of learning content, keep track of academic
performance, and access relevant educational resources --- all while
lacking personalized support and guidance.

Most existing platforms offer generic tools that fail to adapt to a
student\'s unique academic context (such as their department, level, or
institution), leaving them overwhelmed and underserved.

There is a clear gap in the availability of an intelligent, personalized
academic assistant that not only understands a student\'s background and
goals but can also:

- Serve as a real-time AI tutor

- Analyze academic performance and recommend improvements

- Administer customized quizzes and test practice

- Provide essential utilities like GPA calculation, result tracking,
  and academic planning

This lack of personalized support leads to inefficient learning, poor
academic planning, and missed opportunities for growth.
